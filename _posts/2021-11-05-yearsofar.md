title: The Year So Far
---
### September:
This year the club began promptly, quickly picking up members from grade 11 classes. They immediately began with TinkerCAD, learning the basics of 3D modelling - to be expanded upon later.

### October:
This month was uneventful save for a single event - the club fair. Here I bolstered interest in the club, and gained several new members - mostly from Grade 12. I'm looking forward to future meetings.

### November:
The club has been running smoothly with regular attendance from the members. I've gotten a few of them started on Fusion 360, and they're working on the basics of mechanical design.
