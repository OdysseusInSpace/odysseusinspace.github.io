## What's happened so far?
At this point the club has been organised and we've acquired the school's old 3D printers. I've gotten them up and working so them members of the club can use them and will teach them to do so shortly.

### Teaching  
Thus far I have taught the club how to use tinkercad and will move on to more complex programs once they demonstrate a proper handling of it. This includes the mechanical constraints inherent in 3D printing, such as what to keep in mind concerning overhangs and bridging.
